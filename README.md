Melody Generator
This project is a Python-based melody generator that uses a Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) neural network to generate musical sequences. It is designed to read MIDI files, process them, and train a neural network to generate new melodies in a specified musical scale.

Requirements
Python 3.x
Libraries: mido, tqdm, numpy, tensorflow, sklearn
Usage
Data Preparation:

Place your MIDI files in the midi directory.
Run the process_midi.py script to convert MIDI files into sequences suitable for training.
Model Training:

Run the train_model.py script to train the LSTM neural network.
Generating Melodies:

Adjust the selected_scale and root_note_name variables in generate_melody.py to select the desired musical scale and root note.
Run the generate_melody.py script to create a new MIDI melody.
Files
process_midi.py: Processes MIDI files and creates sequences for training.
train_model.py: Defines, compiles, and trains the LSTM model.
generate_melody.py: Uses the trained model to generate a new melody.
scales.py: Contains scales for mapping notes to the selected musical scale.
rhythms.py: Defines possible durations for the generated notes.
model.h5: Trained LSTM model.
generated_melody.mid: Example generated melody.
Running the Scripts
Make sure to adjust the file paths in the scripts according to your system.
The generated melodies will be saved as MIDI files in the same directory.
Example
An example generated melody is provided in generated_melody.mid using the default settings.
